# Moscowtime

A Web page to display a Moscow Time Clock

"Moscowtime" is BTC price in sats per dollar, expressed as a time of day (24 hour clock).
Eg. BTC price of $43,000 is 23:36
    BTC price of $63,000 is 15:52  (note 1587 sats/dollar '87' is normalized to 52 minutes)

In contrast to the "Doomsday Clock", which marches gradually towards a midnight of "hypothetical global catastrophe" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock)

,the "Moscowtime Clock" moves *backwards* toward midnight, when hyperbitcoinization will be complete, and the new Bitcoin Golden Age will be well underway.


### todo: 
- host it somewhere
- add an analog clock display as well
- produce it in a "blawk clawk" style (well, beware of NVK)
and maybe also a form factor for use by @countbtc, "MSCW TIME"
